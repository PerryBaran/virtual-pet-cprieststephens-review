# Virtual Pet

I built this virtual pet using JavaScript as a project for Command Shift bootcamp. I wrote the tests using Jest. 

Features:
- The pet ages and becomes hungrier and less fit.
- Users can walk, feed and talk to their pet.
- The pet dies once it reaches 30 days old, or doesn't receive enough food or exercise.
